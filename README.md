## 🌟 Who I Am?
I’m a third-year AIML student who enjoys exploring different parts of machine learning — from classical ML to deep learning, from vision to signal-based systems, and from prototyping to deployment.  
I like understanding how things work under the hood and building solutions that feel practical and meaningful.

My areas of interest include:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Speech & Signal Analysis  
- System design & ML-driven applications  

---

## 🚀 What I Work On  
I enjoy working on problems where ML can make a process smoother or more efficient.  
Whether it’s a quick prototype, a data-driven workflow, or a model-backed application, I try to focus on clarity, usefulness, and learning something new each time.

I’ve been part of **Team Luminous**, which won:
- **Nexathon 2025** — 24-hour national hackathon  
- **DevHack (DevHost-2025)** — 36-hour national hackathon  

Both were great learning experiences and pushed me to think faster and build smarter.

## 🎭 Outside the Code  
I stay active in my college community as well:

- **Joint Cultural Secretary**, Bhoomika Kala Sangha  
- Member, **IEEE VCET Student Branch**  
- Contributor at **CoRE**, our research-driven peer-learning club  

These roles help me stay balanced and improve how I work with people.

---

## 🧰 Tools I Use  
**Languages:** Python, C, C++  
**ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-Learn  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm  
**Other:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Flutter, basic full-stack concepts
