<h1 align="center">Hey, I'm Srinivas.</h1>
<p align="center">AIML Engineer in the making • Applied ML Enthusiast • Hackathon Winner</p>

---

## 🌟 Who I Am  
I’m a third-year AIML student who loves working on applied machine learning — especially systems that interact with real-world signals and human speech.  
I enjoy taking ideas from scratch → model → deployment, and I’m always exploring how to build cleaner, smarter, more impactful systems.

My work usually sits at the intersection of:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Speech Processing  
- Practical System Design  
- Full-stack ML-driven applications  

---

## 🚀 What I Do  
I like solving problems where ML can genuinely make someone’s life easier.  
Whether it's speech dysfluency analysis, model-powered web apps, or experimenting with new architectures, I’m all about building things that *work* — not just demos.

I’ve also been part of the winning team **Luminous** at:
- **Nexathon 2025** (24-hour national hackathon)  
- **DevHack – DevHost 2025** (36-hour national hackathon)  

---

## 🎭 Outside the Code  
Along with engineering, I’m active in the cultural and student community:
- **Joint Cultural Secretary**, Bhoomika Kala Sangha  
- Member of **IEEE VCET Student Branch**  
- Active contributor at **CoRE**, VCET’s research-focused tech club  

These roles keep me grounded, improve how I work with people, and make life much more interesting than just staring at model logs all day.

---

## 🧰 Tools I Work With  
**Languages:** Python, C, C++  
**ML/AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-Learn  
**Dev & Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm  
**Others:** Flutter, NumPy, Matplotlib, basics of full-stack engineering
