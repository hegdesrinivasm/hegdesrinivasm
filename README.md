<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Srinivas 👋</h1>
<p align="center">AIML Engineer • ML Generalist • Builder of Practical Systems</p>

## 🌟 About Me  
I’m a third-year AIML student who enjoys working across the machine learning spectrum — from classical ML to modern deep learning techniques, from vision to signal processing, and from model development to deployment.

If it can be optimized, analyzed, automated, or reverse-engineered, I’m probably already curious about it.

Current interests include:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Speech & Signal Analysis  
- Full-stack ML-powered applications  
- Clean, systemic software design

## 🚀 What I Build  
I love tackling real-world problems and turning them into working systems — whether that's a prototype built in a sprint, a full application, or an ML model designed for actual use.

I’m part of the winning team **Luminous**, champions of:
- **Nexathon 2025** — 24-hour national hackathon  
- **DevHack (DevHost-2025)** — 36-hour national hackathon  

These events taught me to think fast, build faster, and keep solutions practical.

## 🎭 Outside the Technical Space  
Apart from engineering, I enjoy contributing to my college community:

- **Joint Cultural Secretary**, Bhoomika Kala Sangha  
- Member, **IEEE VCET Student Branch**  
- Active contributor at **CoRE**, VCET’s research-driven tech club  

These roles keep life diverse — a mix of tech, creativity, and people.

## 🧰 Tech I Work With  
**Languages:** Python, C, C++  
**ML & DL:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm  
**Others:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Flutter, basics of full-stack development
