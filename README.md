## 🌟 Who I Am  
I’m a third-year AIML student who enjoys exploring the entire ML landscape — from classical ML to deep learning, from computer vision to signal analysis, and from modeling to deployment.  
If something can be learned, optimized, or automated, I’m usually already curious about it.

My interests span across:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Speech & Signal Processing  
- Full-stack ML apps  
- Systems thinking & clean engineering

## 🚀 What I Love Building  
I like taking real-world problems and turning them into working systems — fast prototypes, polished applications, or models that meaningfully improve a workflow.

I’ve been part of the winning team **Luminous** at:
- **Nexathon 2025** — 24-hour national-level hackathon  
- **DevHack (DevHost-2025)** — 36-hour national-level hackathon  

Hackathons taught me to move quickly, think clearly, and design solutions that are both smart and usable.

## 🎭 Outside the Technical Bubble  
Engineering isn’t the only thing I do.  
I’m also actively involved in the campus community:

- **Joint Cultural Secretary**, Bhoomika Kala Sangha  
- Member of **IEEE VCET Student Branch**  
- Contributor at **CoRE**, VCET’s research-driven peer-learning club  

These roles give me balance — a mix of leadership, creativity, and teamwork beyond code and models.

## 🧰 Tools I Work With  
**Languages:** Python, C, C++  
**ML & DL:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-Learn  
**Dev Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, PyCharm  
**Supporting Stack:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Flutter, basic full-stack development
